This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

### 1. Run the app

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### 2. Run Inngest Dev Server (so courses finish "Generating" and show "View")

Creating a course sends an event to generate chapter notes. For that to run locally you need the **Inngest Dev Server**:

1. In `.env.local` add: `INNGEST_DEV=1`
2. In a **second terminal** run: `npm run inngest:dev`
3. Keep both terminals running. Create a course again; after a short time it should show "View" instead of "Generating".

Without the dev server, events go to Inngest Cloud, which cannot reach localhost, so the course stays on "Generating".

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
